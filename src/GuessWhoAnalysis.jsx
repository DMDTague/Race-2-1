            On November 17, 2015, Mark Rober—former NASA engineer, Apple product designer, and now 
            the 37th most-subscribed YouTuber with over 71 million followers—released a massively 
            popular video arguing that he had found a dominant strategy for Guess Who.

            Nearly a decade later, on November 21, 2025, Dr. Nica released a full YouTube lecture 
            revisiting this research and illustrating how his dynamic-programming method identifies 
            an optimal strategy that outperforms naïve binary search.

            To accompany the lecture, he released an interactive online tool titled 
            "Guess Who? Simulator" on marimo.app. Despite the name, the simulator does not use 
            faces or features. Instead, it uses a number-based abstraction.

            <strong>The Mathematical Model:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Each player secretly chooses a number (1–N)</li>
              <li>You "ask questions" using a slider that defines an interval [a,b]</li>

          <p className="emphasis">
            This is a mathematical model inspired by Guess Who, not a literal implementation 
            of the real board game. And this modeling choice is what creates the discrepancy.

          <p>
            But when I started playing Nica's simulator, I noticed something unmistakably wrong:
          </p>

          <ul className="discovery-list">
            <li>I was winning earlier than I should</li>
            <li>The computer was not taking turns it should have been allowed to take</li>
            <li>The game declared me the winner at moments when I had not actually guessed the number—only reduced my candidate pool to one</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Curious whether anyone else noticed, I searched the comments on Nica's lecture. 
            One comment by @madks13 stood out, proposing a checkbox interface instead of a slider. 
            Yet none of the comments mentioned the issue I had discovered.

            So I decided to investigate further.

          <h2>The Optimal Death Valley Bot vs the Race-to-1 Model</h2>

          <p>
            After rebuilding the game with the correct turn-based rules and the Death Valley
            state preserved, I defined a new value function{" "}
            <code>V(n, m)</code> that matches the actual mathematical structure of this
            corrected game.
          </p>

          <div className="math-block-container">
            <h3>The Value Function V(n, m)</h3>
            <p>
              Here <code>V(n, m)</code> means:
            </p>
            <p className="quote">
              "The win probability for the player whose turn it is, when their candidate
              pool has size <code>n</code> and the opponent's pool has size <code>m</code>,
              under the real turn-based rules with Death Valley (no auto-win at n = 1)."
            </p>
            <p>
              On the 1–20 board, the starting state is{" "}
              <code>V(20, 20)</code>. Solving the dynamic program gives:
            </p>
            <div className="formula-display">
              <code>V(20, 20) ≈ 0.63</code>
              <br />
              <code>b*(20, 20) = 8</code>
            </div>
            <p>
              So in the corrected game, the optimal player to move wins about 63% of the
              time, and the first question is not a perfect half-split. Instead, the
              optimal strategy asks about 8 numbers, not 10:
            </p>
            <p className="quote">
              "Is your number in the first 8 candidates?"
            </p>
            <p>
              The bid function <code>b*(n, m)</code> is the subset size that maximizes{" "}
              <code>V(n, m)</code> at each state. It is computed by the DP via:
            </p>
            <div className="formula-display">
              <code>
                V(n, m) = max<sub>1 ≤ b ≤ n−1</sub> [
                (b/n) · (1 − V(m, b)) + (1 − b/n) · (1 − V(m, n − b))]
              </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              After each YES/NO answer, roles swap. Your win chance this turn is{" "}
              <code>1 − V(m, n')</code> because the opponent becomes the player to move
              in the next state. Crucially, there is no special rule that says
              "if n' = 1, you instantly win."

            <p>
              In Dr. Nica's marimo code (and in Rober's mental model), the abstraction is
              different. It implicitly works with a "Race-to-1" value function{" "}
              <code>W(n, m)</code> where:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Hitting <code>n = 1</code> is treated as an absorbing win:{" "}
                <code>W(1, m) = 1</code> when <code>m &gt; 1</code>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Hitting <code>m = 1</code> for the opponent is treated as an absorbing
                loss: <code>W(n, 1) = 0</code> when <code>n &gt; 1</code>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any branch that drives your pool to size 1 is given value 1 immediately.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="emphasis">
              That model optimizes "who reaches a single remaining candidate first,"
              not "who actually wins in a turn-based game where the opponent still
              gets a final guess."
            </p>
            <p>
              In other words, <code>W(n, m)</code> is a pure deduction race.{" "}
              <code>V(n, m)</code> is a turn-based game with Death Valley: you can know
              the answer, pass the turn, and still lose.

            <h3>Why the Old Model Loses Games the Optimal One Wins</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Overvaluing knowledge:</strong> In the Race-to-1 model, driving
                your pool from <code>n = 2</code> to <code>n = 1</code> is treated as a
                literal win. In the real game, it just means you enter Death Valley: you
                know the answer but must pass the turn and survive.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ignoring the opponent's counterplay:</strong> When the opponent's
                pool is already small, slamming into <code>n = 1</code> can actually be
                dangerous. They now get a high-probability shot to steal the game on
                their next move.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Too-sharp splits near the endgame:</strong> Race-to-1 DP keeps
                choosing bids that maximize the chance of hitting <code>n' = 1</code>{" "}
                immediately. The ODV DP sometimes prefers a bid that leaves{" "}
                <code>n'</code> at 2 or 3 while keeping the opponent wider, because
                surviving the next turn matters more than "knowing right now."
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Small local errors, global gap:</strong> These tiny misplays in
                Death Valley states accumulate. A symmetric Race-to-1 style strategy
                hovers around a 0.62/0.38 split for the first player, while the corrected
                ODV strategy reaches the true ~0.63/0.37 split.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="emphasis">
              In short: the Race-to-1 abstraction optimizes the wrong objective
              ("first to deduce"), so it leaks a small but real slice of games that the
              Optimal Death Valley bot wins in the fully corrected model.

            Dr. Nica's simulator does not simulate Guess Who.

              This was the core issue that no one in the comments had mentioned — and the one

            </p>
            <p>
              By eliminating Death Valley, the Race-to-1 model fundamentally changes the strategic 
              landscape of the game. It's not just a simplification—it's a different game with 
              different optimal strategies.

                <p>
                  Hello Dr. Nica. I've sent you an email explaining what I believe is an error in your marimo code. 
                  It appears that your simulator treats "reducing your possibilities to one number" as an immediate win, 
                  ending the game the moment a player logically deduces the opponent's answer. In the real Guess Who? 
                  board game, however, narrowing your possibilities to one is not a victory—you must still declare 
                  your final guess on a later turn.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, if the range of the number your opponent has is between 4 and 5 and player 1 asks 
                  whether the opponent's number is 4, if the opponent's number is 5, your program correctly returns 
                  NO (and with that the only possible number is 5) but then immediately declares that player 1 is 
                  the winner. In the physical game however, player 1's turn would end at that moment, and the opponent 
                  would still get a final turn to guess, which can change the outcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By collapsing "knowing the answer" into "winning the game," the simulator unintentionally models a 
                  different game. More of a pure 'race to deduce the final candidate' rather than the actual turn-based 
                  structure of Guess Who?. I'm not sure if this is the same code you used for the simulations in your 
                  2015/2016 paper, but if it is, I believe the same error may appear in those simulations too.
                </p>

                  Thanks for pointing this out! It's not an error, the rule you described is a clearly stated version 
                  on how we model the game. Hasbro has several rules out there with different rules depending on the 
                  exact edition you buy (it seems to mostly depend on the target audience being older vs younger kids). 
                  This rule set is the most mathematical and has the most interesting structure.

                <p>
                  Thank you for clarifying! I understand now that the "auto-win once reduced to one candidate" rule 
                  is an intentional modeling choice rather than an implementation mistake. My only concern was that 
                  this rule meaningfully alters the game-theoretic structure of Guess Who? compared to the standard 
                  Milton Bradley/Hasbro rules, where deduction does not end the game and a player must still spend 
                  a turn to declare the guess.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This additional turn can shift the distribution of victory outcomes, since players can sometimes 
                  overcome split or otherwise unfavorable probabilities, slightly changing the overall odds of winning. 
                  Under the official rules, a player can know the answer and still lose if it isn't their turn, whereas 
                  in the modeled version this dynamic disappears entirely. That shift can influence the optimal strategies 
                  produced in simulation and can make the paper's title slightly misleading if interpreted strictly within 
                  the classic ruleset (wherein my confusion was).
                </p>
                <p>
                  This distinction is especially relevant for the ruleset used in Mark Rober's binary-search style play. 
                  Even with the "Death Valley" principle defined in the dashboard I shared with you, and even with this 
                  distinction, your method still appears to produce the optimal strategy for that form of turn-based 
                  play, especially when compared to Rober's proposed binary search method—the confusion came solely from 
                  this modeling choice, not from any actual inaccuracy. I only wanted to confirm whether the difference 
                  was intentional since it does affect the strategy space. Thanks again for the explanation!

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
              Dr. Nica's clarification confirms that the Race-to-1 win condition was a deliberate design choice 
              motivated by mathematical elegance. While this makes for a more tractable analysis, it fundamentally 
              changes the strategic landscape compared to the standard Guess Who? rules where Death Valley exists.
            </p>
            <p>
              The key takeaway: both models are valid—they simply answer different questions. Nica's model asks 
              "what's optimal in a pure deduction race?" while the standard rules ask "what's optimal when turns 
              and timing matter?" Understanding this distinction is crucial for anyone applying these theoretical 
              results to actual gameplay.
